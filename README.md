# Judopay Swift SDK

The Judopay Swift SDK is a framework for integrating easy, fast and secure payments inside your app with [Judopay](https://www.judopay.com/). It contains an exhaustive in-app payments and security toolkit that makes integration simple and quick. If you are integrating your app in Objective-C, we highly recommend you to use the [JudoKitObjC](https://github.com/judopay/JudoKitObjC) port.

Use our UI components for a seamless user experience for card data capture. Minimise your [PCI scope](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/completing_self_assessment) with a UI that can be themed or customised to match the look and feel of your app.

## Requirements

Version 8.1+ requires Xcode 10.3 and Swift 5

Version 8.0+ requires Xcode 10 and Swift 4.2

Version 7.0+ requires Xcode 9 and Swift 4

Version 6.2.5+ requires Xcode 8 and Swift 3

Version 6.2.4 is the last version to support Xcode 7.3.1 and Swift 2.2

## Getting started

#### 1. Integration

If your integration is based on **Carthage**, then visit [our GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/JudoPay/JudoKit/wiki/Carthage).

If you are integrating the SDK **manually** then follow the guide [here](https://github.com/JudoPay/JudoKit/wiki/Manual-integration):

If you are integrating using **CocoaPods**, follow the steps below.

- You can install CocoaPods using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

- Add JudoKit to your `Podfile` to integrate it into your Xcode project:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'

target 'YourApp' do
    use_frameworks!

    pod 'JudoKit', '~> 8.1.0'
end
```

- Then run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

- Please make sure to always **use the newly generated `.xcworkspace`** file not not the projects `.xcodeproj` file.

- In your Xcode environment, go to your `Project Navigator` (blue project icon) called `Pods`, select the `JudoKit` target and open the tab called `Build Phases`.
- Add a new `Run Script Phase` and drag it above the `Compile Sources` build phase.
- In the shell script, paste the following line:

```bash
sh "${PODS_ROOT}/DeviceDNA/Framework/strip-frameworks-cocoapods.sh"
```

#### 2. Setup

Add `import JudoKit` to the top of the file where you want to use the SDK.

You need to set your token and secret when initializing JudoKit:

```swift
// initialize the SDK by setting it up with a token and a secret
var judoKit = JudoKit(token: "<TOKEN>", secret: "<SECRET>")
```

To instruct the SDK to communicate with the Sandbox environment, include the following lines in the ViewController where the payment should be initiated:

```swift
// setting the SDK to Sandbox Mode - once this is set, the SDK wil stay in Sandbox mode until the process is killed
judoKit.sandboxed(true)
```

When you are ready to go live you can remove this line.

#### 3. Make a payment

```swift
func paymentOperation() {
    guard let ref = Reference(consumerRef: "<CONSUMER_REFERENCE>") else { return }
    try! judoKit.invokePayment(judoId, amount: Amount(decimalNumber: 0.01, currency: currentCurrency), reference: ref, completion: { (response, error) in
        self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
            
        if let error = error {
            if error.code == .userDidCancel {
                self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
                return
            }
                
            var errorTitle = "Error"
            if let errorCategory = error.category {
                errorTitle = errorCategory.stringValue()
            }
                
            self.alertController = UIAlertController(title: errorTitle, message: error.message, preferredStyle: .alert)
            self.alertController!.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .cancel, handler: nil))
            self.dismiss(animated: true, completion:nil)
                
            return
        }
            
        if let resp = response, let receipt = resp.items.first {
            self.cardDetails = receipt.cardDetails
            self.paymentToken = receipt.paymentToken()
        }
            
        let sb = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
        let viewController = sb.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "detailviewcontroller") as! DetailViewController
            
        viewController.response = response
        self.navigationController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
    })
}
```
**Note:** Please make sure that you are using a unique Consumer Reference for each different consumer.

## Next steps

Judopay's Swift SDK supports a range of customization options. For more information on using Judopay for iOS see our [wiki documentation](https://github.com/JudoPay/JudoKit/wiki/) or [API reference](https://judopay.github.io/JudoKit).
